 * Claude Code's skills and custom commands on OpenCode (BLG-686). OpenCode runs a message starting
 * `/name` as one of its own commands when it has one: its built-ins (init, review, compact), its
 * own commands, and your Claude Code skills, which it loads itself from ~/.claude/skills and a
 * project's .claude/skills. What it doesn't have is mapped:
 * - a Claude Code custom command (commands/<name>.md) becomes the prompt, $ARGUMENTS filled in;
 * - a skill OpenCode didn't load (a plugin's) goes in as its instructions;
 * - one of Claude Code's own built-ins goes in as plain text, said in a note.
