# Beluga on a server

Beluga runs with no window on a computer that stays on: a Linux server, a home PC, a Mac mini.
Your projects, worktrees and agents live there; you use them from your phone, or open the whole
Beluga app in any browser. The README has [the short version](../README.md#run-it-on-a-server);
this is the rest.

## What it needs

- **Linux or macOS**, x64 or arm64. On Linux, glibc 2.28 or later: Ubuntu 20.04, Debian 10,
  RHEL 8 and newer.
- **curl** (or wget) to install, and **git** for your projects (`sudo apt install git` if it's
  missing).
- **A Claude subscription.** Beluga downloads Claude Code itself the first time it needs it.
- No sudo, no Node, no open port.

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/kayraucklnc/beluga/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

It puts Beluga, with its own Node, in `~/.beluga/server` and links the `beluga` command into
`~/.local/bin`. When that folder isn't on your PATH yet, it prints the line that adds it, like:

```sh
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Run that, then open a new terminal (or `source ~/.bashrc`).

To install a particular release (its tag from the
[releases page](https://github.com/kayraucklnc/beluga/releases)), or link the command into another
folder, set these before `sh`:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/kayraucklnc/beluga/releases/latest/download/install.sh | BELUGA_VERSION=<tag> sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/kayraucklnc/beluga/releases/latest/download/install.sh | BELUGA_BIN_DIR="$HOME/bin" sh
```

## Set up

```sh
beluga setup
```

Five steps, each skipped when it's done already. Stop it at any point and run it again: it picks
up where you left off.

1. **Claude**: signs Claude Code in (below).
2. **This computer**: the name your phone shows for it.
3. **A project**: a folder on the server, or a git URL to clone. Enter skips it.
4. **Your phone**: a QR code to scan with the Beluga app. Enter skips it.
5. **Keep it running**: installs the service, so Beluga starts when the computer does.

For a script or cloud-init, `beluga setup --yes` takes every default and asks nothing (sign
Claude in with `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, below), and `--project <folder or git URL>` adds a
first project.

### Signing Claude in on a server

A server has no browser, so setup uses Claude Code's own `claude setup-token`:

1. It shows a link. Open it on your laptop or phone and sign in to Claude.
2. Claude shows a code: paste it back into the server's terminal.
3. Claude Code prints a long token starting `sk-ant-`. Copy it, and paste it when setup asks (it
   stays hidden).

Beluga keeps the token in `~/.beluga/claude-token`, readable by you alone, and gives it only to
the Claude Code it runs. It never prints or logs it.

Already have a token (from `claude setup-token` elsewhere)? Set it and run setup, which keeps it:

```sh
CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=sk-ant-… beluga setup
```

If Claude Code on the server is already signed in the usual way, setup says so and moves on.

## Keep it running

Setup's last step is the same as:

```sh
beluga service install
```

- **Linux**: a systemd user service, `~/.config/systemd/user/beluga.service`. It starts again if
  it stops by itself. To start at boot and keep running after you log out, systemd needs
  lingering on for you; Beluga turns it on when it can, and otherwise prints the one line to
  run: `sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER`.
- **macOS**: a launchd agent, `~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.github.kayraucklnc.beluga.server.plist`.
  It starts when you log in. For a Mac mini that restarts on its own, turn on automatic login in
  System Settings › Users & Groups.
- **A container, or no systemd**: run `beluga up --foreground` as the container's command, or
  `beluga up`, which runs until the computer restarts.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `beluga status` | whether it runs, its version, projects, phones, relay and browser access |
| `beluga logs -f` | follow its log |
| `beluga up` · `beluga stop` | start it, stop it (a stopped service stays stopped) |
| `beluga service` | whether the service is installed |
| `beluga service remove` | stop it and don't start it at boot any more |
| `beluga project add <folder or git URL>` | add a project; a URL is cloned into your projects folder, `--into <folder>` picks another |
| `beluga project list` · `beluga project remove <name>` | list projects, remove one (its folder stays) |

## Your phone

Get the Beluga phone app (Android: `Beluga-<version>.apk` on the
[releases page](https://github.com/kayraucklnc/beluga/releases/latest)). Setup pairs one phone;
for another, on the server:

```sh
beluga pair
```

Scan the QR code with the app (or type the code under it), then confirm on both. `beluga phones`
lists the paired phones and removes one.

The phone reaches the server directly and end to end encrypted, from any network: nothing to open
on the server. When a network blocks a direct connection, it goes through Beluga's relay instead
(a Cloudflare tunnel the server opens), still end to end encrypted: Cloudflare carries only
ciphertext.

## In a browser

The whole Beluga app, the one the Mac shows, also opens in any browser. Beluga serves it on the
server's own `127.0.0.1:7777`, which nothing outside the server reaches; each way in below brings
it to you.

Every browser is let in once, with a **join link**: it works one time, for 10 minutes. The browser
then stays signed in (for 90 days after it was last used). Links are made only on the server,
never from a browser.

```sh
beluga web link          # a new join link
beluga web sessions      # the browsers let in
beluga web revoke <name> # sign one out, at once
beluga web --off         # close browser access, every way in
```

Browser access stays on across restarts until `beluga web --off`.

A browser has no menu bar, so the gear at the top left of the sidebar holds it: **Settings…**
first, then Keys and Commands, Everything You Can Do… (⌘K), and the File, View and Go menus.
Settings there change the Beluga on the server, as the Mac app's do; how it looks (appearance,
text size) is kept by each browser.

### Through Tailscale

You need Tailscale on the server and on your laptop or phone, logged in to the same tailnet. Then,
on the server:

```sh
beluga web --tailscale
```

It prints `https://<server>.<tailnet>.ts.net` and a QR code for your phone's browser. Open it from
any of your devices: your own Tailscale login gets straight in. Anyone else on your tailnet needs
the join link printed under it; run `beluga web --tailscale` again for a new one. It uses
Tailscale Serve, never Funnel: only your tailnet can reach it. On a machine tagged in Tailscale
(owned by no one), every browser needs a join link.

### Through SSH

On your laptop (Linux or macOS), with the `beluga` command there too from the same install line
(it starts nothing there):

```sh
beluga connect you@your-server
```

It asks the server for a join link over ssh (starting Beluga there if it isn't running), opens
an SSH tunnel, and opens your browser through it. A dropped tunnel comes back by itself; Ctrl+C
closes it. Any host from `~/.ssh/config` works, with its user, port and keys. Nothing is opened on
the server.

Without Beluga on the laptop, run `beluga web` on the server. It prints a join link and the ssh
line to run on the laptop:

```sh
ssh -N -L 7777:127.0.0.1:7777 you@your-server
```

Leave that running and open the join link on the laptop.

### A public link

With neither Tailscale nor SSH, on the server:

```sh
beluga web --public
```

It opens a Cloudflare tunnel and prints a `https://….trycloudflare.com` address with a join link
under it. That link works from anywhere, once, for 10 minutes. **Anyone with a join link gets
in**; the address alone shows only a page that asks for one, and wrong links are limited hard.
Keep join links to yourself, and `beluga web sessions` shows who came in. Run
`beluga web --public` again for a new join link.

The address changes when the tunnel restarts; `beluga status` shows the current one. A domain of
your own that stays the same: [docs/web.md](web.md#your-own-domain).

## Updating

```sh
beluga update
```

It runs the install line again, which replaces `~/.beluga/server` in place and starts Beluga again
on the new version if it was running. Your projects, phones, browsers and sign-in stay. Pasting
the install line yourself does the same.

## Removing

```sh
beluga web --off
beluga service remove
beluga stop
rm -rf ~/.beluga/server ~/.local/bin/beluga
```

That removes Beluga's program. Your settings, paired phones, browsers and Claude token stay in
`~/.beluga`; to forget them too, `rm -rf ~/.beluga`. Your projects' folders are never touched.
On the phone, remove the computer from the app.

## What each way in lets through

Beluga's own key to itself (the token in `~/.beluga/daemon.json`) never leaves the server: every
phone and browser gets its own way in, which you can take back.

| Way in | Who can reach it | Who gets in | Opened on the server | Take it back |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Phone | anyone, over the internet | a phone you paired, by its own key | nothing | `beluga phones` |
| Tailscale | your tailnet only | your Tailscale login; others with a join link | nothing (Tailscale Serve) | `beluga web --off` |
| SSH | whoever can ssh in | a browser with a join link | nothing | `beluga web revoke` |
| Public link | anyone with the address | a browser with a join link | nothing (an outgoing tunnel) | `beluga web --off` |

A browser or phone that's in can do what you can on the server: run agents, open a shell, read and
write your files. So:

- Join links are one use, 10 minutes, and their secret never reaches a server log.
- A browser's session is a cookie scripts can't read; the server keeps only its hash, and revoking
  it cuts the browser off at once.
- On a server other people log in to, use join links rather than Tailscale's login check: another
  account on the same machine could pretend to be Tailscale.
- The Claude token stays in `~/.beluga/claude-token` (0600) and goes only to Claude Code.

The details, and the review behind them: [docs/security.md](security.md#web-access).

## When something doesn't work

**`beluga: command not found`** right after installing: `~/.local/bin` isn't on your PATH. Run the
`echo 'export PATH=…'` line the install printed, then open a new terminal.

**The phone can't connect.** Some networks block the UDP a direct connection needs. Beluga's relay
covers that: `beluga status` says whether the relay is ready. If it says the relay isn't
running, `beluga logs` says why; the server needs outgoing https to Cloudflare for it. The phone
says what it found too, under **Why?**. Pairing with the QR code works even where a typed code
can't find the server.

**Tailscale says it isn't connected**, or isn't installed: install it with
`curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh`, log in with `sudo tailscale up`, then run
`beluga web --tailscale` again. Beluga says the one thing to fix when:

- Tailscale needs your say-so to serve as you: `sudo tailscale set --operator=$USER`, once.
- HTTPS certificates are off for your tailnet: turn them on in the Tailscale admin console › DNS ›
  HTTPS Certificates.
- The machine has no name: turn on MagicDNS in the admin console › DNS.

**SSH: "is port … free here?"** `beluga connect` uses port 7777 on your laptop when it's free, and
another one when it isn't. If ssh still can't open the tunnel, choose one:
`beluga connect you@your-server --port 7790`. For the plain ssh line, change the first `7777`:
`ssh -N -L 7790:127.0.0.1:7777 you@your-server`, then open the join link with `7790` in place of
`7777`.

**Port 7777 is busy on the server**: run Beluga's web port on another one,
`beluga web --listen 127.0.0.1:7778`. `beluga connect` follows it by itself.

**`beluga connect` says Beluga isn't installed** on the server: install it there (the line above).
`beluga connect` looks for it in `~/.local/bin` and on the PATH of a plain ssh command; installed
with `BELUGA_BIN_DIR` somewhere else, put that folder on the PATH in `~/.profile`.

**A public link stopped answering**: Cloudflare quick tunnels sometimes drop. Beluga opens a new
one by itself; `beluga status` shows its new address, and `beluga web --public` gives a fresh
join link.

**Anything else**: `beluga status`, then `beluga logs -f`.
