/**
 * The sharer's overlay (BLG-717, src-tauri/src/call_overlay.rs): while you share your screen and
 * look at another app, you don't see Beluga, so it comes to you, over the screen you share. A soft
 * frame around it says it's on show; what the others draw and point at shows where they made it;
 * what they write in the chat pops up bottom right and dissolves. Sharing one window (not a whole
 * screen), there's no way to know where it sits, so only the chat shows. Back in Beluga, it goes:
 * the chat is right there. Sharing one window, the shell finds where that window is (by its size
 * and title, src-tauri/src/shared_window.rs) and the overlay covers just it, following it as it
 * moves; not found, only the chat shows (BLG-743). macOS is asked to leave the overlay out of what's shared; since macOS 15
 * it doesn't always, so the overlay first checks (call/leak-probe.ts). If it's in the picture, it
 * still shows (pointing at a screen its owner can't see is no use, BLG-743), and the others hear
 * so: they leave pointers to the picture instead of drawing their own over it, so nobody sees one
 * twice (BLG-736). Ink lands on the same spot either way.
